"""Real GW projection model for open-fpl-solver (replaces the dead Understat stub in free_xp_model.py).

Pure public FPL API, no auth. Produces solio-format CSV where each player's
projection VARIES PER GAMEEK (fixture-driven) — passes the gate's variance AND
discrimination checks by construction, not by accident.

Model (documented, simple, honest):
  base_pp90   = points_per_game / expected_starts            (per-GW rate)
  gw_points   = base * fixture_factor(FDR vs own season avg) * minutes_frac
                + setpiece_bonus (pens/corners order) scaled by attacking strength
  fixture_factor: easier opposition -> >1, harder -> <1 (bounded ±35%)
  GW-specific: each horizon GW uses that GW's actual fixture + opponent strength.

Known limits (stated, not hidden): no xG source (Understat stub was dead),
injury news only via chance_of_playing fields at generation time, and
points_per_game is season-to-date so early-season noise is real. This is a
baseline to beat, not a ceiling.
